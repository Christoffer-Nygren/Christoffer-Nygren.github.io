# What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

What is Open Graph? Open Graph lets you control how your website is presented when other are sharing the website in social media, it's different meta tags in the head section of the website in use. 

Open Graph as said above works through meta-tags in the head section and there are four required  meta-tags:
* og:title - which as said is the title.
* og:type - which is the kind of object shared like video, picture and so on.
* og:image - is the image that shows up when you share the site.
* og:url - Url of object that will be used as permanent ID in the graph.

There are also a lot of other settings you can add to your Open Graph like for example audio or video.

I implemented it to my site with only the four standard tags and added a nice picture i liked aswell as an title describing my website, when sharing it also takes a bit from the part you share and puts it in the link.
