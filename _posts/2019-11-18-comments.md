# How did you implement comments to blog posts?

For the comments that you can see below every single blogpost is made by the use of Disqus, a free service for comment support on websites and the only thing you have to do is register an account on their site and then grab the code they provide to you. After that you just type:

`comments: true` in the markdown file.

After I implemented it I customized it a bit using SCSS and gave it a background aswell as a border-radius for a smoother look on the site, the background-color I used is the same as on the footer and header.
