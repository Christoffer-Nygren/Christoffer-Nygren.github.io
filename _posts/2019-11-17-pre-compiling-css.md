# What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
I think pre-compiling the css is great especially with scss because it has "tools" that makes it easier to customize and saves you time with stuff like nestling and variables for colors and other stuff. And in short what SCSS does is that it takes the code you write and converts it to normal css so its really only for having it easier for the developer to code. For me it has saved me time using the implemented features like nestling and variables and also it has made it easier to work with.

# Compare to regular CSS
SCSS offers a lot of tools that CSS currently does not have but CSS is starting to catch up with some of these stuff like with variables, you can now "use" variables in normal CSS too but i would say the way SCSS has it implemented is still easier and better but then we have stuff like nestling which is so much better than writing everything out multiple times. For example instead of writing #id p, to get the p-element in a div you can just open the div-element in SCSS and then inside that open the p-element and in the same element you can open different elements who also are in the same div within the same brackets in SCSS.
