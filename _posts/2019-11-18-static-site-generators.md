# What do you think of static site generators?
I'm using a static site generator for this site and it's called Jekyll and I think that static site generators like for example Jekyll are great for building and maintaining websites. They are also mostly pretty easy to work with even though it might be somewhat overwhelming in the beginning but once you actually start working with it everything kind of get together and works easily. It also uses markdown for writing the content that then is generated to HTML-code which makes it a lot easier writing stuff like this.

# What type of projects are they suitable for?
Static site generators should mostly be used for easier smaller websites but can also be used for bigger projects but it all depends on the purpose the website has. In situations like real-time updates it can be delayed because the site must be rebuilt again and re-deployed so with that it might be better using something else.
