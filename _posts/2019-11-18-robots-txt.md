# What is robot.txt and how have you configured it?
It's a small text file located in the root of given website and is what tells the search engines what "robots" should do when visiting your site, I have mine configured so they are not allowed to visit the site.
It looks something like this:

`User-agent: *`

`Disallow: /`

# What is Humans.txt and how have you configured it?
It's also a small text file located in the root but this file provide readable information for us humans about the website. It may contain information like owner of the website, social media info, team credit and so on. My Humans.txt is configured like below.
