My name is Christoffer Nygren and I am a 20 year old student in Kalmar studying development and operation of software systems. My interest are mostly programming, playing video games and socialising/partying.

This site is made for the current course 1dv022 which is a client based webbprogramming course to teach us how to create applications for the web browser by using different kind of software and patterns.
